    <h1>My Sister's Funeral</h1>
    <h3>Gerald Stern, 1925</h3>

    <article>
      Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it<br>
      all alone, which made the two of us closer<br>
      though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would<br>
      have been better I think sometimes to be sterile<br>
      from the start just to avoid the pain<br>
      which in my life this far has lasted seventy<br>
      years for I am in love with a skeleton<br>
      on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,<br>
      on whose small skull a bit of curly hair<br>
      was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know<br>
      since there was no mother to turn to then and ask<br>
      what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,<br>
      and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it<br>
      true somebody said the other peach<br>
      should have died instead of her; and I could<br>
      imagine the nose going first though forty years later<br>
      the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;<br>
      and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips<br>
      who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,<br>
      a flabby body, half the house was filled with<br>
      male cousins, they were born in rooms a<br>
      short distance from the rats, I can’t remember<br>
      which ones had the accents nor what his<br>
      Hebrew name was, nor his English.<br>

    <h1>Sonnet [Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,]</h1>
    <h3>Karen Volkman</h3>

    <article>

      Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,<br>
      the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell<br>
      dispensing damage like a hollow hell<br>
      inchling weeping for a minor sea<br>
<p></p>
      ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.<br>
      The blue beneficence we call and spell<br>
      and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well<br>
      of constant water, deepening a thee,<br>
<p></p>
      a thou and who, touching every what—<br>
      and in the or, a shudder in the cut—<br>
      and that you are, blue mirror, only stare<br>
<p></p>
      bluest blankness, whether in the where,<br>
      sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught<br>
      drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.<br>
